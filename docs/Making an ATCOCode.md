# Making an ATCOCode

## Bus

An ATCOCode should be comprised of:

- Your local prefix, you'll find this in the CPTG database. If it isn't there,
  contact me.
- The literal character: `0`
- Up to 8 uppercase alphanumeric characters, make up your own system

It is advised that you stay away from codes that may need to be used for
entrance points (RSE, TMU). It is also advised that you cooperate with other
areas which you share an ATCO prefix with.

    isn't there, contact me.

- The literal character: `0`
- Up to 7 uppercase alphanumeric characters, based on the name of the station
- For RPLs and RSEs only: 1 uppercase alphanumeric character to distinguish
  different platforms or entrances

  - For TMUs: your local prefix, you'll find this in the CPTG database. If it
